16-May-2003
~~~~~~~~~~~
New icon (Geoff Youngs).
Added 'basedir' module for freedesktop.org Base Directory specification.

06-May-2003
~~~~~~~~~~~
Added functions to read MIME database (Stephen Watson).

27-Jan-2003 (Release 1.9.6)
~~~~~~~~~~~
Make the default window class the name of the application directory, not
'AppRun' (suggested by Albert Wagner).
Bugfix: With pygtk-1.99.14, only the first error message from a process
	would be detected; this meant that ROX-Lib wouldn't detect when the
	process quit (reported by joehill).
Bugfix: <hbox> and <vbox> layouts didn't work in the options box (Allen
	Leonard).

22-Jan-2003
~~~~~~~~~~~
If python is too old, raise SystemExit instead of quitting.
Ensure that True and False are defined.

16-Dec-2002
~~~~~~~~~~~
Work around bug in some versions of pygtk that stopped the options window
from working.

12-Dec-2002 (Release 1.9.5)
~~~~~~~~~~~
Upgrade Options box to new style.

11-Dec-2002
~~~~~~~~~~~
Bugfix: If an option had an empty value, an exception was thrown on loading
	(reported by Stephen Watson).

05-Dec-2002
~~~~~~~~~~~
Cope with missing input_add_full.

25-Oct-2002
~~~~~~~~~~~
Pygtk 1.99.12 seems to more-or-less work now (according to Alastair Porter), so
remove the warning for that so we can support RedHat 8.0.

20-Oct-2002 (Release 1.9.4)
~~~~~~~~~~~
More warnings about old pygtk versions.
Added Dialog class (does ref-counting, like Window).

15-Oct-2002
~~~~~~~~~~~
Trying to use ROX-Lib2 with earlier versions of python now gives a sensible
error message.

10-Oct-2002
~~~~~~~~~~~
Make clicking on ROX-Lib itself work again (Christopher Arndt).

25-Aug-2002
~~~~~~~~~~~
Updated findrox.py to use pygtk 1.99.13 -- update your programs!

25-Aug-2002 (Release 1.9.3)
~~~~~~~~~~~
Switch to use new pygtk versioning system (requires pygtk 1.99.13).

19-Aug-2002
~~~~~~~~~~~
Added 'processes' module, based on code in Archive, which makes controlling
subprocesses easier.

14-Aug-2002
~~~~~~~~~~~
Bugfix: Changing the keys lost any builtin shortcuts (Gtk behaviour has
	changed since 1.2).

08-Aug-2002
~~~~~~~~~~~
Trap exceptions when activating menu items and report nicely.

07-Aug-2002
~~~~~~~~~~~
Bugfix: Remember to call drop_finish() after a drag-and-drop operation.

05-Aug-2002 (Release 1.9.2)
~~~~~~~~~~~
Renamed XDSLoader module to 'loading' (like 'saving').
Added 'mime' module for installing extra MIME information.
Bugfix: XDSLoader didn't handle the drag-drop signal, and so only worked for
	widgets with their own implementation!

31-Jul-2002
~~~~~~~~~~~
Show local variables in report_exception, and allow expressions to be
evaluated in the context of any frame.
Added StringSaver class.

25-Jul-2002
~~~~~~~~~~~
Added applet module for creating ROX panel applets.

24-Jul-2002
~~~~~~~~~~~
Bugfix: saving code didn't cope with missing images (reported by Musus Umbra).

21-Jul-2002
~~~~~~~~~~~
If 'gtk2' isn't available, see if 'gtk' is actually the 2.0 version.
Added save_set_permissions to Saveable interface, allowing the default
save_to_file to preserve file permissions.
Changes to XDSLoader: xds_load_from_stream(name, type, stream)
replaces the old xds_load_data(data).
Loading files from remote filers works now.
Added much improved exception reporting system.

19-Jul-2002 (Release 1.9.1)
~~~~~~~~~~~
Added support for translations.

18-Jul-2002
~~~~~~~~~~~
License change to the LGPL (allows commercial programs to use this library).
Added AbortSave exception.

14-Jul-2002
~~~~~~~~~~~
Saveable.save_to_file() should raise an exception when saving fails, rather
than returning 0. The return value is now ignored (note that raising an
exception will still work with 1.9.0).
toplevel_unref() ignores any arguments, so it is easier to use as a signal
handler.

12-Jul-2002 (Release 1.9.0)
~~~~~~~~~~~
First release for Gtk+-2.0.
