~~~~~~~~~~~
If 'gtk2' isn't available, see if 'gtk' is actually the 2.0 version.
Added save_set_permissions to Saveable interface, allowing the default
save_to_file to preserve file permissions.
Changes to XDSLoaded: xds_load_from_stream(name, type, stream) replaces
the old xds_load_data(data).

19-Jul-2002 (Release 1.9.1)
~~~~~~~~~~~
Added support for translations.

18-Jul-2002
~~~~~~~~~~~
License change to the LGPL (allows commercial programs to use this library).
Added AbortSave exception.

14-Jul-2002
~~~~~~~~~~~
Saveable.save_to_file() should raise an exception when saving fails, rather
than returning 0. The return value is now ignored (note that raising an
exception will still work with 1.9.0).
toplevel_unref() ignores any arguments, so it is easier to use as a signal
handler.

12-Jul-2002 (Release 1.9.0)
~~~~~~~~~~~
First release for Gtk+-2.0.
