~~~~~~~~~~~
License change to the LGPL (allows commercial programs to use this library).

Saveable.save_to_file() should raise an exception when saving fails, rather
than returning 0. The return value is now ignored (note that raising an
exception will still work with 1.9.0).
top_level_unref() ignores any arguments, so it is easier to use as a signal
handler.

12-Jul-2002 (Release 1.9.0)
~~~~~~~~~~~
First release for Gtk+-2.0.
