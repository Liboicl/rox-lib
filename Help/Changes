~~~~~~~~~~~
Renamed XDSLoader module to 'loading' (like 'saving').
Added 'mime' module for installing extra MIME information.
Bugfix: XDSLoader didn't handle the drag-drop signal, and so only worked for
	widgets with their own implementation!

31-Jul-2002
~~~~~~~~~~~
Show local variables in report_exception, and allow expressions to be
evaluated in the context of any frame.
Added StringSaver class.

25-Jul-2002
~~~~~~~~~~~
Added applet module for creating ROX panel applets.

24-Jul-2002
~~~~~~~~~~~
Bugfix: saving code didn't cope with missing images (reported by Musus Umbra).

21-Jul-2002
~~~~~~~~~~~
If 'gtk2' isn't available, see if 'gtk' is actually the 2.0 version.
Added save_set_permissions to Saveable interface, allowing the default
save_to_file to preserve file permissions.
Changes to XDSLoader: xds_load_from_stream(name, type, stream)
replaces the old xds_load_data(data).
Loading files from remote filers works now.
Added much improved exception reporting system.

19-Jul-2002 (Release 1.9.1)
~~~~~~~~~~~
Added support for translations.

18-Jul-2002
~~~~~~~~~~~
License change to the LGPL (allows commercial programs to use this library).
Added AbortSave exception.

14-Jul-2002
~~~~~~~~~~~
Saveable.save_to_file() should raise an exception when saving fails, rather
than returning 0. The return value is now ignored (note that raising an
exception will still work with 1.9.0).
toplevel_unref() ignores any arguments, so it is easier to use as a signal
handler.

12-Jul-2002 (Release 1.9.0)
~~~~~~~~~~~
First release for Gtk+-2.0.
